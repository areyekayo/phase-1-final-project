# Rick and Morty Character Database
This single page application features characters from Rick and Morty television show on [Adult Swim](https://www.adultswim.com/), using the public [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/).

The MVP of this application fetches 20 characters from the API, and features a character name search and species filter. Users can search and filter separately to dynamically refine their searches. To reset the search and filters, click the "Clear All" button to load all characters again.

This application was made for the Flatiron School's software engineering curriculum.
